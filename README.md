# LLM Repository

This project is a framework that provides a developer with the programmatic means to auto-generate and populate custom objects with a given structure with data obtained from querying LLMs.

The framework translates the structure of the custom model classes into queries for LLMs and translates the subsequent responses of an LLM into structured responses which are used to generate and populate the desired model objects:
